The G4L project had an earlier author (nme), who original started
the project. Then it moved to fra_step, who wrote the current
version. 0.14beta, which is vastly different than 0.10

I've made modification to the g4l 0.14beta script to make
it better for my needs, and to provide this to others to use or not
