## Michael Setzer II - Program Modifications
pcnt=0

## Created a function for the Progress Screen instead of multiple
## copies using multiply files. Just setup 1 function with a msg variable
## to set the minor differnces between earlier versions.

progress()
{
## Added a redirection of stderr from ncftp commands.
## Would get an error message rarely about a register 82 problem with duplex
## mismatch. This error would message the contents of the screen, but the updates
## of the progress would go on. Redirects output to file, and then displays last
## two lines of the file.
## This just sets the starting value as being OK
  
  echo "OK" >/tmp/ncftpstatus.out
## Added the Start time of the process to the progress screen
## Removed - Replaced with modification to jetcat-mod to
## Display MBs of data transferred of total, and Elapsed time.
## starttime=`date +%T`
  (
  while test "$pcnt" != "100"
  do
## changed to a common progress.out file for all progress
    pcnt=`tail -n1 /tmp/progress.out`
    echo "XXX"
## Modified Jetcat-mod to display two decimal positions
## have to cut off the decimals for the gauge to work.
    echo $pcnt | cut -d. -f 1
    echo "\n"
## msg variable set before calling the progress function to
## make minor variation between different screens.
    echo "Progress\n"
    echo "The progress bar shows the percentage of the amount written\n"
    echo "to the size of the destination.\n\n"
    echo "Please stand by, this will take some time!\n\n"
## Percentage displays with 2 decimal places, plus start time and current time.
## This lets one check time status of process in addition to percentage
    echo "Progress"
    echo "$pcnt\n"
## Removed Current time and Start time for modified jetcat-mod
##echo "Current Time:	`date +%T`"
##echo "Start Time:  	$starttime"
## add display of last four lines of ncftp stderr if any.
    echo -n "ncftpstatus: "
    ncftpstatus=`tail -n4 /tmp/ncftpstatus.out`
    echo $ncftpstatus
    echo "XXX"
    sleep 5
  done
  ) |
  $DIALOG --backtitle "$backtitle" --title "Working..." --clear --gauge "One moment..." 20 70
## Outputs start time and current time, so it can be checked if one isn't around at end
## of process. Also, note one can use Ctrl-Alt F2 to switch to another screen to review
## the file contents or use the special command option.
## Added a pause to let the user see final results before it returns.
