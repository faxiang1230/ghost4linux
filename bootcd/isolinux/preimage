To prepare an disk or partition to be imaged, it is best to clear all 
unused space on the partitions. G4L uses dd to copy the information 
from the partitions, and copies all sectors from the drive regardless
of if it contains current data or old data.

Note - New blank6 uses number for temp files to handle larger drives

To Clear this a number of programs have been included.
For use on a FAT or NTFS process you can use blank6.
blank6 creates 2GB Null files on the default drive until the drive is full.
blank 6 also accepts a drive letter prompt to process.
blank6 c  or blank6 d

On linux or unix systems the following can be used.
cleandrive is a very simple script to create a Null file to use all free 
space, and then delete it.
cleandrive5, or 6, or 7, or 8 are modified versions that provide a graph 
display of the process and time information using xdialog and dialog.
The scripts might need to be modified if the output of df is in a different
format. Also, lblank7 is linux version of blank program.
