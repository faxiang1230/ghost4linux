To run the program after selecting the kernel is to enter ./g4l
(Note: that is G 4 L)

Options:
g4l - Brings up the g4l script with no defaults.

The program accepts the following values, that must be entered in order
g4l parm1 parm2 parm3 parm4 parm5
parm1 - IP address of the ftp server
parm2 - Image file name with extension to determine compression
parm3 - User id and password (two format options)
        userid:password   or '-u userid -p password' (quotes required)
parm4 - dhcp  (use dhcp to get ip address automatically)
parm5 - default directory to store image files is img, but can be changed.
parm6 - eth0 (default or other device)
parm7 - reboot (if blank no reboot, if non-blank reboot)\n\
        can now also be poweroff. System will poweroff instead of reboot.
