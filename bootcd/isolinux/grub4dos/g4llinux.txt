Below is the info from RIPLinux instructions for setting up grub4dos
to be able to boot riplinux. I have just made g4llinux.exe to do the
same, but it has the bz27.7 kernel file and ramdisk.gz for the file
system. 

Have made a single menu.lst file that has both XP and Vista options,
so it should work with either. The other option lines can be deleted.

To setup g4l to boot this way, you would just need to copy the grldr program
to the root of the windows boot disk along with the menu.lst file. Then create
a sub directory linux, and place the bz27.7 kernel and ramdisk.gz. Then just
do the options listed below. If you use another kernel, you will need to 
modify the menu.lst file. I don't have a VISTA systems, so have not tested 
that setup directly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to install and boot RIPLinuX on a Windows Vista/XP system,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract linux.exe from the root directory.
C:\linux.exe  "Self extracting Zip archive!"

You'll then have this.
C:\grldr
C:\menu.lst
C:\linux\kernel
C:\linux\rootfs.cgz

Rename C:\bootmgr to bootmgr_vista
Rename C:\grldr to bootmgr

Under Windows you will probably need administrator privilege to see and
rename bootmgr. 
C:\> attrib -h -s -r bootmgr
C:\> ren bootmgr bootmgr_vista
C:\> attrib +h +s +r bootmgr_vista 
C:\> ren grldr bootmgr
C:\> attrib +h +s +r bootmgr 

It's easy to do it in Linux.
# ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1  "Mount Windows partition read-write!"
# cd /mnt/sda1
/mnt/sda1# mv bootmgr bootmgr_vista
/mnt/sda1# mv grldr bootmgr

Under Windows XP, just do this.
Append the line below to C:\BOOT.INI.
C:\GRLDR="Start GRUB"
Rename C:\menuxp.lst to menu.lst

The next time you boot the Windows Vista/XP system, GRUB will
present you with a menu to boot Windows or Linux.
