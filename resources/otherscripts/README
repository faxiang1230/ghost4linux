These are some special scripts that I use in the building of g4l.
They are customized to my build structure, so would probable need
to be modified to work on a directory structor that is different.

chkfiles - run in each of the bin sbin and lib directories to check 
           if the files in the g4l directories match with the files
           on the build system, so after doing systems updates the 
           g4l can be kept in sync.

failsafe - script to create the failsafe.cfg from isolinux.cfg

newg4l   - Used to run the makecdrm script to build updatd g4l iso 
           and development now with volid

out2.fix - run after chkfiles if files are newer to copy the changed
           files. Note: if the version of a file as in the library
           changes the file will be listed as missing, and one manually
           needs to delete the old versions, and copy the new ones with 
           linked files. I generally create a gz file of library in the
           system location, and then just extract them in the matching
           location.

chkldd   - Is located in the /bin directory, and it checks that all the 
           files and programs in the bin sbin and lib directores are meet.
           If it reports any not found, the missing items will need to be 
           added.

g4lup    - Script to upload files to my alpha server. userid and pasword 
           replaced in this copy.
